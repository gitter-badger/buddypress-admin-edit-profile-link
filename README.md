BuddyPress - User Profiles Edit Links for Admins
-----------------------------------------------
####BuddyPress Plugin

A very simple and tiny BuddyPress plugin for WordPress to provide a convenient link next to each user listed in the WordPress users administration dashboard page pointing to that user BuddyPress profile edit page. Useful if you use BuddyPress extended profiles and want to manage your users faster or edit their profiles (default templates from WordPress do not allow edits on the frontend from admins).

Works with BuddyPress 1.6 and above (should work with 1.3-1.5 as well but untested) and WordPress 3.3 and above (untested with earlier versions).

To install, download from Github and place plugin in WordPress plugin folder (note that Github usually renames the plugin directory name, this should be called `buddypress-admin-edit-profile-link`). Activate from WordPress plugins dashboard page and that's it.
